# Affix-ID-tattoo
Åffix® ID-tattoo is the smart moduled system, each of which has dedicated function. The  innermost layer, composed of semi-absorbable, biocompatible material will attach to the user’s  dermal surface, where the process of limited, temporal extraction of the DNA from the cells will take  place. A priorly determined (after the user’s genetic code acquisition) biochemically established  DNA-complementary reagent (ligand), located in the microfluidic mixer layer (2nd), will bind to the  extracted DNA initiating signal generation within 3D printed flexible electronic circuit (3rd layer) to  activate quantum dots on the outermost layer
