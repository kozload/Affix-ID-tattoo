# Affix-ID-tattoo
One might observe an increased interest in smart bio-responsive devices being on the target of most pharmaceutical or, in general, medical technology companies, where physiological signals are being exploited for precise diagnosis or/and targeted therapy. Such adhesive systems, e.g. in transdermal drug delivery, resemble as important constituent in human-machine interactions, as advances in bio-inspired design of their architecture and multifunctional bioelectronics progresses. Printing technology serves here as a gate to overcome old-fashioned methodologies, obstacles and limitations, for further applications and new challenges.

Åffix® ID-tattoo is the smart moduled system, each of which has dedicated function. The  innermost layer, composed of semi-absorbable, biocompatible material will attach to the user’s  dermal surface, where the process of limited, temporal extraction of the DNA from the cells will take  place. A priorly determined (after the user’s genetic code acquisition) biochemically established  DNA-complementary reagent (ligand), located in the microfluidic mixer layer (2nd), will bind to the  extracted DNA initiating signal generation within 3D printed flexible electronic circuit (3rd layer) to  activate quantum dots on the outermost layer
